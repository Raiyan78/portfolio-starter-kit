title: 'Enhancing the security of image transmission in Quantum era: A Chaos-Assisted QKD Approach using entanglement'
publishedAt: '2023-11-30'
summary: 'The emergence of quantum computing has introduced unprecedented security challenges to conventional cryptographic systems, particularly in the domain of optical communications. This research addresses these challenges by innovatively combining quantum key distribution (QKD), specifically the E91 protocol, with logistic chaotic maps to establish a secure image transmission scheme. Our approach utilizes the unpredictability of chaotic systems alongside the robust security mechanisms inherent in quantum entanglement. The scheme is further fortified with an eavesdropping detection mechanism based on CHSH inequality, thereby enhancing its resilience against unauthorized access. Through quantitative simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme in encrypting images, achieving high entropy and sensitivity to the original images. The results indicate a significant improvement in encryption and decryption efficiency, showcasing the potential of the scheme as a viable solution against the vulnerabilities posed by quantum computing advancements. Our research offers a novel perspective in secure optical communications, blending the principles of chaos theory with QKD to create a more robust cryptographic framework.'
